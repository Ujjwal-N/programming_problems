# programming_problems
These are all of the [Kattis problems](https://open.kattis.com/) I attempted while participating in the SJSU Competitive Programming Club's Weekly Contests and some additional practice. As of November 28, 2020, I have won one of these contests.
All of these files are named after the Kattis problem id. The partial folder contains solutions that did not satisfy all test cases or timed out, and the solved folder contains solutions that passed all test cases within the time limits.

I will eventually create a showcase of problems.
