# Programming Problems
## Description
* These are all of the [Kattis problems](https://open.kattis.com/) I attempted while participating in the SJSU Competitive Programming Club's Weekly Contests and some additional practice problems. 

* These problems involve knowledge of data structures, algorithms, and math.
I will eventually create a showcase of problems. 

## Layout
* All of these files are named after the Kattis problem id. 
* The solved folder contains solutions that passed all test cases within the time limits.
* The partial folder contains solutions that did not satisfy all test cases or timed out. 
* indexer.py automatically updates the following lists by sorting problems based on its [Kattis difficulty](https://open.kattis.com/help/ranklist)
* diff.txt stores the difficulties of problems after scraping the problem's webpage
